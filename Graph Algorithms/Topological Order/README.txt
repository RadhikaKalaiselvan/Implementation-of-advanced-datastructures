Contains code to find Topological Order of a directed graph, to list the strongly connected components, to check if a graph is Cyclic. 

How to run?
javac GraphProblems.java
java GraphProblems
Enter the no. of vertices in the graph.
Enter the no. of edges in the graph.
enter the edges in (source vertex, destination vertex,weight or 0 ) format
then the following text will be displayed.
Press 1 -TopologicalOrder1, 2-TopologicalOrder2, 3-IsCyclic graph, 4-No. of strongly connected components
Enter any of these 4 number to perform the operation.
